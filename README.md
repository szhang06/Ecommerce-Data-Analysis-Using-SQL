### E-commerce Data Analysis Project Using SQL

### 1. ****Traffic Optimization****

**Business Task**: Optimize bidding strategies for top traffic sources to improve conversion rates and maximize ROI.

**Analysis**:
We conducted an analysis of the top traffic sources and their conversion rates, with a focus on Google Search's non-brand campaign, which accounted for the highest session volume. To evaluate the effectiveness of this source in driving sales, we calculated the conversion rate from session to order. With a conversion rate of 0.0288, which is significantly lower than the desired threshold of 4%, we recommend reducing the bid for Google Search's non-brand campaign.

Following the bid reduction, we monitored weekly performance. Sessions and orders showed a decrease in volume, which prompted further investigation into performance by device. For desktop, we observed 3911 sessions, 146 orders, and a conversion rate of 0.0373, while mobile sessions and orders were 2492 and 24, respectively, with a conversion rate of 0.0096. Based on this, we recommend increasing the bid for desktop devices, which showed more favorable performance. Post-bid adjustments, sessions on desktop increased significantly, while mobile sessions remained flat or slightly declined.

### 2. ****Website Performance****

**Business Task**: Identify bottlenecks in the customer journey and optimize website performance to increase conversion rates.

**Analysis**:
Our goal was to assess the performance of key web pages and identify opportunities for optimization. We found that the most viewed pages were the home page, product pages, and the product fuzzy page. The home page served as the primary entry point, and its performance in terms of sessions and bounce rate was evaluated. The bounce rate was found to be 0.5918, which is relatively high for paid search traffic. After conducting an A/B test on the home page, we found that the new version reduced the bounce rate to 0.5324, compared to 0.5834 for the original version. We recommend updating paid search campaigns to direct traffic to the new home page version and monitoring performance weekly.

Next, we analyzed the conversion funnel, focusing on the pages with the lowest conversion rates: the landing page, product fuzzy page, and billing page, with conversion rates of 0.4707, 0.4359, and 0.4377, respectively. These pages should be targeted for optimization to improve overall conversion.

### 3. ****Channel Portfolio****

**Business Task**: Optimize marketing spend by comparing performance across multiple traffic channels.

**Analysis**:
The company recently launched a new traffic channel, **bsearch**, and wanted to compare its weekly performance with the existing **gsearch non-brand** channel. While **bsearch** generated about one-third of the session volume of **gsearch non-brand**, it still presented a substantial opportunity for further optimization.

We analyzed the performance by device and found that mobile sessions accounted for 0.0862 for **bsearch** and 0.2452 for **gsearch non-brand**. To optimize the marketing budget, we examined the session-to-order conversion rates for both channels by device. The results showed that **bsearch** underperformed on both mobile and desktop, indicating that a reduction in the bid for **bsearch** would improve the overall paid marketing budget performance.

### 4. ****Product Portfolio****

**Business Task**: Assess the performance of the newly launched product and its impact on overall business metrics.

**Analysis**:
To understand the impact of the company's new product, we began by analyzing the monthly trends for the flagship product, tracking key metrics such as sales, total revenue, and total margin. After the launch of the second product, we observed an increase in all metrics, including order volumes, conversion rates, revenue per session, and a breakdown of sales by product.

We next analyzed whether the increase in performance was due to the growth of the business or the second product. By comparing the click-through rates (CTRs) from the product page to each of the two products before and after the launch, we observed that the CTR for the first product declined slightly, while the overall CTR improved. This indicated that the second product contributed to the overall increase in performance.

To further assess the impact of the second product, we examined the conversion funnels for both products. Product 2 showed a higher conversion rate from the product page to the cart, while other metrics remained similar. Based on these results, we can conclude that the second product has positively contributed to the business.

### Cross-Sell Analysis

**Business Task**: Evaluate the effectiveness of a new cross-sell feature in increasing average order value (AOV) and conversion metrics.

**Analysis**:
The company introduced a cross-sell feature allowing customers to add a secondary product to their primary cart. We analyzed the performance of this feature by comparing the click-through rates (CTR), average products per order, average order value (AOV), and overall revenue per cart page before and after the feature's launch.

The analysis revealed a slight positive trend across all metrics, indicating that the cross-sell feature was effective in encouraging customers to purchase additional products. While the increase was modest, the feature likely contributed to a higher AOV and overall revenue per cart, suggesting that this strategy has potential for continued optimization.

### Conclusion

In summary, we have provided insights into various aspects of the company's e-commerce strategy, including traffic optimization, website performance, channel portfolio analysis, and product portfolio performance. Key recommendations include:

* **Traffic Optimization**: Reduce bids for mobile sessions on Google Search non-brand and increase bids for desktop to improve performance.
* **Website Performance**: Redirect paid search traffic to the new home page version and optimize pages with low conversion rates.
* **Channel Portfolio**: Adjust bidding strategies for **bsearch** based on its underperformance compared to **gsearch non-brand**.
* **Product Portfolio**: The second product has positively contributed to overall business performance, with higher CTRs and conversion rates for the new product.
* **Cross-Sell**: The cross-sell feature has shown positive results, increasing AOV and revenue per cart.
